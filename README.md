# my.siyli.org Policies

This repository is intended to store any legal documents including but not limited to a Terms of Service (ToS), Privacy Policy, etc for the my.siyli.org application.

The intent of storing these in a public github repository is so that we can be transparent about changes made to these policies over time, as well as the rational behind those changes.

We are a small non-profit with the goal of spreading tools of wisdom and compassion to enough people in the world to create the conditions for world peace.

We will screw up some of this legal stuff as we iterate but hope that, by doing so in the open, we can do so with integrity :)
